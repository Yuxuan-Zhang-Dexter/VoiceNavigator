**VoiceNavigator: AI-Powered Speech-to-Speech Web Interaction System**

VoiceNavigator is an innovative application that combines real-time voice assistance, LLM-driven computer operation, and image-to-text tasks to enable a hands-free online experience. With the power of AI, it allows you to navigate, operate, and interact with your computer and web applications using voice commands.

## ✨ Features

1. 🎧 **Real-Time Voice Assistant**: Interact with the system seamlessly using voice commands.
2. 🤖 **LLM-Driven Computer Operations**: Perform actions like opening applications, interacting with web pages, and more.
3. 🖼️ **Image-to-Text Tasks**: Extract and interpret text from images for enhanced accessibility and productivity.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for understanding and executing complex commands.
- For example:
  - Saying "Open YouTube" and "Open Chrome" triggers the backend API, letting the LLM operate your computer to perform these tasks.
  - The LLM can also describe the content of the webpage you're interacting with, providing contextual insights.

Enjoy a fully hands-free, voice-controlled experience powered by cutting-edge AI technologies.

### 🌐 Frontend Setup

The frontend is a **Next.js TypeScript** app.

1. Navigate to the project directory for the frontend.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend server will start, and you can interact with the system via the web interface.

### ⚙️ Backend Setup

The backend is a Flask app that supports LLM-driven operations and image-to-text tasks.

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ./src/VoiceNavigatorBackend
   ```
2. Install the package and its dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend will host an API to enable:
   - 🤖 LLM-driven computer operations, such as opening applications or interacting with web pages.
   - 🖼️ Image-to-text functionality for interpreting images.
